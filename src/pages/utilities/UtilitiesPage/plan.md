# Utilities Playground plan

## 2026-07-19 unified interactive page

- [x] Consolidate all 14 utility categories into the single `/utilities` page while preserving legacy deep-link routes.
- [x] Provide category tabs, composable class controls, live preview, reset, generated markup and clipboard copy.
- [x] Provide search, quick navigation and responsive breakpoint reference in the same page.
- [x] Support dark design tokens and collapse the preview/config workspace to one column without horizontal overflow on narrow screens.
- [x] Cover category rendering, interaction, search, copy behavior and navigation compatibility with focused tests.
- [x] Verify the result in a real browser at desktop and narrow viewport sizes.

## 2026-07-19 restrained playground revision

- [x] Return to the existing Playground's flat border/header/source structure without gradients, grid decoration, large radii or decorative cards.
- [x] Put each utility title in its header, keep preview on the left and place every control/action in the right configuration panel.
- [x] Replace tabs and checkbox composition with two ElfUI Select controls and a single active utility class.
- [x] Rename the top-level navigation item to `样式和动画` and place it immediately after 首页 while preserving legacy routes.
- [x] Cover single-selection replacement, generated code, reset/copy and navigation position with focused tests and real-browser dark-theme interaction.

## 2026-07-19 standard source and outer-scroll revision

- [x] Remove the page description, search, horizontal directory, per-lab descriptions and notes.
- [x] Reuse the shared `elf-playground` source area for all 14 labs, including Template/Script tabs, language label, copy action and code panel.
- [x] Keep preview and controls in the flat two-column workspace while removing page-owned scrolling and source overflow.
- [x] Group Utilities under the no-icon `样式和动画` parent and verify the hierarchy, dark theme and standard source area in a real browser.
